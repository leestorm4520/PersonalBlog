# PersonalBlog
This will be my personal website where I contemplate my personal thoughts and perspectives on different things happening to me on a daily basis
It might as well promote my work on different aspects. Also, I am gonna use it to write blogs on a variety of topics like stocks, traveling, studying abroad,
culture, religions,....

This will be my very first agenda!!!
